    "### Using the `csv` library\n",
    "\n",
    "The `csv` library contains objects and other code to read, write, and process data from and to CSV files. Essentially, we want to read each row in the `.csv` file and stores its information for later use. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How `csv` works\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`csv.DictReader()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader) function creates an object that operates like a regular reader - where information is returned as [strings](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str) - but maps the information in each row to an [OrderedDict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) whose keys are given by the optional `fieldnames` parameter. If `fieldnames` is omitted, the values in the first row of file f will be used as the fieldnames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each row is an `OrderedDict` object, we know that information in each dictionary will be in the same order as they appear within the `.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspect the first two rows in the `raw_data/EXTR_RPSale.csv` file"
